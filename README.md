Simple Architeture of Chef

With a simple cookbook like Jamie Oliver :)

To upload them to our chef server.

We can do that individually by typing:

knife cookbook upload apt
knife cookbook upload nginx

Or, we can upload everything by typing:

knife cookbook upload -a

And Execute Chef:

sudo chef-client

:)
